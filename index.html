  <h3>Unit 1: Basics of the Web</h3>

  <div class="subheadingbox">
    <h4>The Web</h4>
      <p>
      The web is a collection of html documents, that are linked by <em>Hyper Links</em>.  HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is the basis for everything on the web.  When we use our <b>computer/browser</b> (the program that runs on our computer to display files found on the web), to connect to the <b>internet</b> (the world's largest computer network), through <b>HTTP</b> (the main protocol of the web), then it connects to the <b>servers</b> (which host the files that make up the web).
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="subheadingbox">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
      <p>
      HTML is made up of:
      <ul>
        <li><em>text content</em> (what we see) </li> <li><em>markup</em> (what it looks like)</li> <li><em>references to other documents</em> (e.g. images & videos)</li>  <li><em>links to other pages</em></li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      HTML markup consists of an opening tag and closing tags.  The entire piece of code is called an <em>element</em>.  <em>Attributes</em> are listed after the elements, but before the corresponding <em>value</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Images(img elements) and links (a elements) are self-closing and are considered <em>Void</em> tags, because they don't contain content.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="subheadingbox">
    <h4>A Little More Information...</h4>
      <p>
      In HTML <em>Whitespace</em> turns everything into one line.  To seperate content into multiple lines we could use the "br" tag (which is a Void tag and it stands for "break").  The "p" tag is also another option (this element contains content and thus is not a void tag; it stands for "paragraph").
      </p>

      <p>
      <em>Inline</em> and <em>Block</em> elements are used to seperate content.  An example of an inline element would be "br" because it just adds a break in the HTML line and wraps remaining text to the next line.  An example of a block element would be "p" because it creates an invisible box around the content.  Block elements also have a height and width.
      </p>

  <h1>Structured Document: HTML</h1>

  <h3>Unit 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h3>

  <div class="subheadingbox">
    <h4>Page Structure</h4>
     <p>
      Websites are like a house: <em>HTML</em> is the structure or framing, <em>CSS</em> is the styling or color decor, and <em>Javascript</em> is the functional parts or garage door.
    </p>  

    <p>
      HTML uses elements in a tree like structure, from which other elements branch.
    </p>

      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQJUQjXDpyycZwyIeJ3nNt23b8BAfwnXBrBw2FtxiPwqoaKLyuy">

      <h6>Example of HTML tree</h6>

    <p>
      When in developer mode in a browser, you can click through the HTML to see how the elements are nested, as well as viewing any styling that had to been added to that particular element.
     </p>
  </div>

  <div class="subheadingbox">
    <h4>HTML, CSS, & DOM</h4>
      <p>
        HTML is a <b>language with syntax+rules</b>, CSS is a <b>language that uses syntax+rules to change how elements look on the page</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Tags</em>: are part of elements that make up an HTML tree.  They know to do this through <em>DOM</em> (Document Object Model) which, is the standard convention for representing and interacting with HTML elements.  The tree we view in developer mode is the DOM tree that the browser built from the HTML document.

        <ul>
          <li>Each tag has an element that describes what type it is (e.g. p for paragraph)</li>
          <li>Each tag can have attributes with values</li>
        </ul>

        An element consists of the beginning tag to the ending tag, and everything in between.  The content could be empty, text, or another element!
      </p>

      <p>
        With CSS you could say all h1 elements that belong to class “article” should be dark blue.  To tie structure and style together the HTML doc can provide the browser wth what style to use and where to get it from.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="subheadingbox">
    <h4>Boxes, Boxes Everywhere!!</h4>
      <p>
        Even if a shape is a circle, in HTML it’s still a box.  If you right click and inspect element of a circle, it will show you where the shape is in the HTML document.  And it will show a highlighted area of a box on the webpage, so what makes it a circle? ....
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><em>Border Radius</em></b> property.
      </p>

      <p>
        By thinking of things in boxes it’s easier to rearrange your website.  A grid in background makes sure everything is aligned.  When plotting your squares and layout of HTML structure, remember:  <b>START BIG AND GO SMALLER</b>
      </p>

  <h1>Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h1>

  <h3>Unit 3: Adding Style <span>(cuz' everyone loves someone with style...)</span></h3>

  <div class="subheadingbox">
    <h4>Understanding CSS (aka Cascading Style Sheet)</h4>
      <p>
        Now for some general laws...just like in our society; we have national laws, state laws, local municipality laws, and house rules.  CSS has laws/rules.  The most specific ruleis applied to every element.  Thus, our "house laws" would be the same as our "national laws".
      </p>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSRxsP2w9jbFar8fXmVOXY4nOgZcYOTFZxQ88ilmowubiRFa6iu">
      <p> 
        Cascading means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match but also to all of the elements' child elements.  However, if a child element has multiple overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rules apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        When using CSS it can be helpful to think about it as a Search-n-Replace tool.  You identify a "class" or "tag" of the element you want to match and then what you want to do with, or what property values to replace with different ones.  Also, <em>where</em> and in what <em>order</em> matter.  Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions:
        <ul>
          <li>the default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles</li>
          <li>stylesheet in a separate file (mostly used)</li>
          <li>stylesheet inside a HTML (used for smaller projects, not ideal)</li>
          <li>inline style in an element (should be avoided)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

       <p>
        <em>Inheritance</em>: relies on the ancestor/descendant relationship to operate.  The idea by which properties are applied, not only to a specified element, but also it's descendants.  It relies on the document tree, the hierarchy of HTML elements.  Child elements may inherit CSS properties from any ancestor element enclosing it; they can also inherit text related properties, but box related properties are not inherited.
        <ul>
          <li>Properties that can be inherited:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>color</li>
              <li>font</li>
              <li>letter spacing</li>
              <li>line height</li>
              <li>list style</li>
              <li>text align/indent</li>
              <li>text transform</li>
              <li>visibilty</li>
              <li>white space</li>
              <li>word spacing</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Properties that can't be inherited:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>background</li>
              <li>border</li>
              <li>display</li>
              <li>float & clear</li>
              <li>height & width</li>
              <li>margin</li>
              <li>min & max/ height & width</li>
              <li>outline</li>
              <li>overflow</li>
              <li>padding</li>
              <li>position</li>
              <li>text decoration</li>
              <li>vertical align</li>
              <li>z index</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="subheadingbox">
    <h4>Selectors</h4>
      <p>
        Selectors are what allows you to targe specifc HTML elements and apply style to them.  By doing this, you can condense your CSS to avoid unnecessary repetition, which waste time, and time is precious.  It is recommended that CSS and HTML are kept in two different files, by keeping the design away from the document they are easier to edit.  Selectors can be combined. Below is a list of different type of Selectors.
        <dl>
          <dt>ID Selectors</dt>
            <dd>
              Most powerful type of selector, beat out other types of selectors and styles.  Having lower specificity selectors are easier to override.
            </dd>
          <dt>Class Selectors</dt>
            <dd>
              Most useful and versatile.  Well supported in all browsers.  Add multiple classes separated by space on HTML elements.  Also JavaScript stuff you can do specifically for manipulating classes.
            </dd>
          <dt>Tag Selectors</dt>
            <dd>
              Most useful when changing properties that are unique to HTML element.  Like setting the list style on a "ul" or tab-size on a "pre".  Typically more useful to have class define styling that you can use on any HTML element.
            </dd>
          <dt>Attribute Selector</dt>
            <dd>
              More useful than classes because they have the same specificity value, but they can be any attribute, not just "class".  They also can have a value you can select by.
            </dd>
          <dt>Positional Selectors</dt>
            <dd>
              Several positional selectors beyond: nth-child; using simple expressions (like 3n="every third") you can select elements based on their position in the HTML.
            </dd>
          <dt>Other Pseudo Selectors</dt>
            <dd>
              ":empty" is one of many pseudo selectors, which you can recognize by the ":".  They typically represent something you couldn't know just by the element and attributes alone. *These are different than pseudo elements, which are recognizable by "::"-they are responsible for adding things to the page by the things they select.
            </dd>
        </dl>

    <h4>Revisiting the BOX</h4>
      <p>
        We know that everything on a webpage is made up of a box.  Which consists of 4 parts:
        <ol>
          <li>Content- this is the image or text that appears on the website, comparable to the nucleus of the box, the other layers serve to protect it so other things don't get to close or overlap</li>
          <li>Padding- this clears an area around the content, is affected by background color, and is the space that protects the content directly</li>
          <li>Border- inherits color property of box, incases the padding and content</li>
          <li>Margin- goes around border, outer most layer, provides space between boxes, transparent</li>
        </ol>
         To deal with sizing issues, use: "box-sizing:border-box...however...to make sure older browsers are able to display this CSS, you must add browser specific prefixes "webkit, moz, ms".  If we set box size to percentage rather than pixels, the box sizing will adjust to size of screen.  When positioning boxes remember: *divs are block elements so by default they take up the entire width of a page, to deal with this we can add the "display:flex" to appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other!*  See <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">this link for more information on FlexBox</a>

  <h4>Code, Test, & Refine!!</h4>
	    <p>
        Compare your code to the design you were given...	How to know what to change?
          <ol>
            <li>Get page structure right, by visually boxifying it</li>
			              <ul>
                <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Move on to tags(make heading h1)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Look for repeated styles & semantic elements</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Size of boxes, how big, and how to position</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Write html</li>
                <li>Apply styles(biggest to smallest)</li>
                <li>Fix things!</li>
